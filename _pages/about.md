I'm a Senior studying [Statistics: Data Science](https://catalog2022.byu.edu/physical-and-mathematical-sciences/statistics/statistics-data-science-bs) at Brigham Young University. I love tackling challenging problems and applying what I've learned in class to real-world projects.

#### Why am I studying Statistics and Data Science?

If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.

</blockquote>

I've seen how misleading numbers can be and how easily model predictions can become inaccurate when assumptions are violated. I want to know how data is tortured so I can prevent it from happening in my analyses.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
