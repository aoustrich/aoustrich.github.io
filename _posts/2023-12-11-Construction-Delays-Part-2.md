# An Unsired Outcome

<br>

Right from the start I want to clarify that after looking into this data I’ve realized that my original question cannot be answered (at least right now). 

Perhaps the most important thing to recognize is that I know next to nothing about how government construction projects *actually* work. I don’t know how detailed project proposals are or the intricacies of the bidding process. 

I did find some answers about construction projects but the limitations of my own knowledge and the data prevent me from confidently saying construction companies over promise and then under deliver on projects. 

<br>

------
## Data Limitations
------


- All planned and actual dates for task completion are on the 1st day of the month so a project that started 1 day late and another that started 30 days late would both be considered to be 1 month late. 
- There is no way to know if government employees did the work or indepedent contractors. My original suspicion was that independent contractors looking to win large projects and paydays would over promise their abilities because they knew some projects would have to be completed and the city would have no choice but to pay.
- There are some descriptions about why projects were delayed but there are only 12 different reasons and most are pretty vague. The two most common reasons for all the budget line items (not just the projects included in the Milestones data) are delays caused by budgetary constraints and changes in project scope/design. Changes to scope and design could be influenced by the company doing the work but also by the City and it wouldn’t be fair to blame a company’s project proposal for being way off if it was actually the City’s fault. 
- The city budget data I collected does not clearly define where the non city money comes from. We can’t readily tell if funds come from State or Federal coffers or if some money is donated by concerned citizens. 

<br>

###### Here are all the project delay descriptions in the Milestones data:

<table
  id="table"
  data-click-to-select="true"
  data-toggle="table"
  data-height="460"
  data-pagination="true"
  data-url="{{ 'assets/json/nyc_construction/delayTable.json' | relative_url }}">
  
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <!-- <th data-checkbox="true"></th> -->
      <th data-field="Delay Description">Delay Description</th>
      <th data-field="Count">Count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table> 

<br>

--------

<br>

The closest thing I could find to an answer to the original question is shown in the following plot where we see that only the projects entirely funded by Non City sources have a negative average budget delta (the total cost was less than the original budget amount).

<br>

    </div>
</div>

<br>

Despite the shortcomings from my own knowledge and the data I collected, I still think this project was a success and is a step towards a final answer.

# Over Promising and Under Delivering?

<br>

-------
## Project Timeline  
-------


My orinigal suspicion was that most construction projects would be finished late, but after looking into all the projects I was shocked to find out that only about 22% (1,987/8,966) projects were completed late.

As shown below, approximately 69% (6,203/8,966) of  projects were both started and finished on time.

</div>

It's important to remember that the dates are tracked on a monthly level so each project has a few week window in which it can be started or completed to be counted as "On Time." 

New York City is one of the busiest cities in the world but some boroughs are less busy than others so I wanted to see if there was a difference in project completions by Borough.

The timeline of a project is important but it's not the only factor that indicates if Construction companies over promise and under deliver on projects.  

<br>

-------
## Project Budget
-------

<br>

I originally thought that most projects would cost more than the original plan and I was counter-intuitively happy to learn that my theory was correct. As shown below, over half of the 8,578 construction projects were over budget. 

<br>

Again, I wanted to see if there was a difference between the Boroughs.

It's easy to imagine how some types of projects might be more expensive than others. Comparing a project to paint an entire bridge to one where bathroom sinks are replaced isn't exactly fair. Since the data don't have a manageable granularity for the scope of a project, one of the better ways of comparing different scopes is to look at the differences in the agency managing the project.

Since there were dozens of agencies in the dataset, I thought it was easiest to show the 5 agencies with the highest and lowest average cost delta (cost delta = total cost - original planned cost). 


Here are 5 Agencies with the highest average cost delta:

## Are Late Projects Over Budget?
-------
<br>
Now let's see if projects finished late tend to cost more than anticipated.

<br>

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/nyc_construction/Budget_Status_Late_Projects_heatmap.png" title="Finish and Budget Status Heatmap" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<br>


> ##### Key Takeaway
>
> It's important to note that projects finished later than planned will be somewhat correlated with being over budget since labor costs will increase. With this in mind, it's still shocking that nearly 60% (1160/1938) of projects that were finished late were over budget. 
>
> On the flip side, only about 25% (1160/4743) of over budget projects were finished late.

# Conclusion and Future Analysis
-----

<br>

I wasn't able to full answer my question but it does seem that the idea of construction projects over promising and under delivering might have some truth behind it. After analyzing the available data and reconsidering the problem, it seems that public construction projects in New York City are over promising on budgets but for the most part are accurately promising on project timelines.

Future anaylsis of the main question would be possible if the previously [limitations of the data](#data-limitations) were answered.
